# Udacity_Pytorch
Introduction to Pytorch | Course from Udacity |  March - July 2020
These are some of the completed exercises.  After lesson 4 I started running the code on Colab, as my trusty old Dell E6430 doesn't have a CUDA enabled GPU.  They work seemlessly between GitHub and Colab, but now they don't open nicely on my notebook.  I get a "Notebook validation failed:"  I haven't found a workaround for that yet.

I started the course during the New Zealand Covid-lockdown, but continued during my post-lockdown outdoors action rampage period, some of it from the Mt Hutt ski field cafeteria!

This was a great course full of interesting bleeding-edge content and useful links.  The only downside was that the content and style of the teaching was a bit inconsistent from one lesson to the next. This was partly because it was extracted from a larger 'nano-degree', and also because they used an all-star cast of different programmers between lessons, perhaps without quite enough co-ordination between them.  Anyway it was free, so great value!

There is a little bug in all the original notebooks, the image scripts in the markdown lack "" around the value of the width and height attributes. This needs fixing to display nicely in GitHub.
