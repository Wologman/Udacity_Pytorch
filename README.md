# Udacity_Pytorch
Introduction to Pytorch | Course from Udacity |  March - July 2020
These are some of the completed exercises.  After lesson 4 I moved across to Colab, as my trusty old Dell E6430 doesn't have a CUDA enabled GPU.

This course was great, though a fraction harder than it needed to be just because they used an all-star cast of programmers for the teaching and content creation, so it was a fraction inconsistent.  I started the course during the New Zealand Covid-lockdown, but continued during the post-lockdown outdoors action rampage period, some of it from the Mt Hutt ski field cafeteria!
