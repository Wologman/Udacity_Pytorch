# Udacity_Pytorch
Introduction to Pytorch | Course from Udacity |  March - July 2020
These are some of the completed exercises.  After lesson 4 I moved across to Colab, as my trusty old Dell E6430 doesn't have a CUDA enabled GPU.

I started the course during the New Zealand Covid-lockdown, but continued during my post-lockdown outdoors action rampage period, some of it from the Mt Hutt ski field cafeteria!

This was a great course full of interesting bleeding-edge content and links.  The only downside was it was a fraction harder than it needed to be just because the content and style of the teaching was a bit consistent from one lesson to the next.  This was partly because it was extracted from a larger 'nano-degree', and also because they used an all-star cast of different programmers between lessons, perhaps without quite enough co-ordination between them.  Anyway it was free, so great value!
